# Newsy Project Plan

## Current Status
- **Key Issue**: The application is now fully functional. All previous errors (service initialization, `TypeError`, `ConnectionRefusedError`) have been resolved.
- **Troubleshooting History**: 
  - Initial 503 error (service initialization failure due to missing `lxml`/`serpapi`)
  - `TypeError` in `search_news` (fixed by removing `timeout` arg)
  - `ConnectionRefusedError` (resolved after deleting old logs and restarting the server)
- **Deployment Strategy**: Deployment to Render (backend) and Streamlit Community Cloud (frontend) has been prepared but **postponed** to a future sprint.
- **Next Sprint Focus**: 
  - UI/UX improvements
  - Adding explainability to classifications
  - Enhancing the classification algorithm
  - Exploring Perplexity Sonar API integration
